## Generic overview

This is FreeRTOS based paint application inspired by Windows 98 Paint, created within University of Tartu Embedded Systems course (LOTI.05.085) <br/>
Mainboard is STM32F429I-DISC1 modified with extension PCB, that contains: <br/>
1. Two additional GPIO buttons
2. Joystick potentiometer with ADC + SPI
3. 3x mikroBUS socket
4. FTDI UART – USB

## App overview
Cursor can be moved with joystick. Pressing joystick button toggles draw/move mode. In move mode, you can move cursor without drawing. <br/>
Blue and yellow button allows user to navigate between tabs:
1. Change cursor size
2. Change color
3. Select eraser
4. Clear drawing area

If change cursor/color active, yellow and blue buttons will change those parameters.

**Gui example**

Tab selector          |  Color selector | Size selector

## Code flow

There is 3 tasks in FreeRTOS:
1. Update X position (Update cursor position on the screen according to the joy XY position)
2. Update Y position
3. Read XY joystick position (Read ADC values, process them)

Fact, that X and Y cursor update are independent makes cursor movement smoother. <br/>
To get even smoother cursor movement, next feature were used: cursor speed depending on joystick position from center. <br/>
The far joystick is - the faster is cursor. *Speed* is defined by frequency of task, that can de dynamically changed by changing `taskDelay`:
```
void taskUpdateXPos()
{
    uint8_t taskDelay;
    for (;;)
    {
        ... update cursor pos on screen ...

        taskDelay = joy_getTaskDelayMs(g_cursor_pos.x);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(taskDelay));
    }
}
```
